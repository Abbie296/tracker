      <p className='centre'>We’re a group of students who wanted to create an app that helps people understand how food affects their bodies. We know that sometimes it’s hard to figure out which foods make us feel great or not-so-great, and we thought, “Why not make it easier?”</p>
      <p className='centre'>Our app helps you track what you eat and how it makes you feel, so you can spot patterns and make smarter food choices. Whether you’re trying to figure out if something’s making you feel sluggish, or just curious about how your meals affect your mood, we’ve got you covered.</p>
      <p className='centre'>We started this project because we realized that everyone's body responds differently to food, and sometimes it’s not as simple as just eating “healthy.” We wanted to build something that gives you the tools to figure it out for yourself and feel your best.</p>
      <p className='centre'>At the end of the day, we’re just trying to help people understand their food and feel good doing it!</p>
